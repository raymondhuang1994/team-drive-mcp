# Evidence and recovery

Preserve identity (relative path plus file ID; cloud drive/item identity when applicable), version, actual locator, coverage/gaps, source-check timing and export provenance. Cloud `source_version` combines identity, remote version and content hash; use `content_sha256` for byte equality, never approval status. Prefer a returned cloud `file.origin.web_url` for source links, retaining locator and source_version. `row_count` in JSONL exports counts segments, not business records. Keep absolute artifact paths, temporary download URLs and full private traces out of public answers.

| Condition | Decision |
|---|---|
| Tools absent / invalid configuration / version mismatch | Explain the observed setup issue. For the complete ZIP, follow onboarding.md for read-only probe/profiles and cli.md for configured runtime checks; live status can start indexing. Offline Node doctor is available only in the full source checkout. Do not substitute the demo library or claim Skill text provides access. |
| `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `GRAPH_AUTH_REQUIRED`, expired/declined device authorization | Explain that cloud authorization is unavailable. For the complete ZIP, follow the explicitly authorized `python scripts/df-init.py cloud-login` flow in onboarding.md using the company's approved settings and the existing account state location. Only the full source checkout provides `node scripts/login-cloud.mjs`. The user completes Microsoft's flow; do not request passwords or tokens in chat or automatically consent to permissions. |
| `AUTH_ACCOUNT_MISMATCH`, `AUTH_BINDING_MISMATCH`, unsafe/invalid auth cache | Stop using that profile. Preserve its state and credentials; follow the account/scope or cache-path diagnosis. External token rotation or a different account needs explicitly separate profile/state, not deletion of identity checks. |
| `GRAPH_ACCESS_DENIED`, `GRAPH_ITEM_UNAVAILABLE` | Report the denied/unavailable source, not a verified absence. Do not answer from cached text, widen folder/scope or grant access. IT must resolve authorization; refresh and restart the affected evidence chain afterwards. |
| `GRAPH_SOURCE_CHANGED`, `GRAPH_SCOPE_CHANGED` | Restart discovery/refresh and select a current version within the same approved source. Do not merge old cached candidates with new content or accept moved-out items as unchanged. |
| `GRAPH_TIMEOUT`, `GRAPH_THROTTLED`, `GRAPH_UNAVAILABLE`, `GRAPH_SCAN_LIMIT` | Preserve incomplete coverage; follow bounded retry advice or deliberately narrow the task. A failed page is not empty or complete, and a larger limit is not an automatic remedy. |
| `GRAPH_ANCHOR_NOT_EMPTY`, `GRAPH_UNSAFE_URL` or unsafe cloud path | Stop and explain the source/configuration failure. Do not remove unknown anchor files, follow an arbitrary redirect, send tokens to another host or bypass path guards. |
| `SERVICE_BUSY`, `SERVICE_CAPACITY` or legacy `STATE_POOL_EXHAUSTED` | Preserve the configuration. Retry only as advised after a client/lease is released; do not proliferate state directories. Check the reported version/storage mode. |
| `BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE` / interrupted request | Retry on the existing MCP transport if marked retryable. Do not assume an interrupted write was undone or replayed; inspect job/artifact state first. After recovery restart session-bound pagination. |
| `Transport closed` | Reconnect or open a new client session. Changing files cannot revive a client-closed pipe. |
| `SERVICE_CONFIGURATION_CONFLICT` / `SERVICE_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH` | Stop/reconnect the matching service using the documented procedure. Do not mix configurations or silently alter source/state. |
| Source outside root, root/state identity changed, unsafe state, symlink/junction/reparse rejection | Stop using the affected path. Stay inside the authorized source; no automatic permission changes, root widening or deletion. |
| `INDEXER_UNHEALTHY`, recoverable checkpoint / `STATE_REBUILD_REQUIRED` | Follow the actual recovery status. Only explicitly rebuild disposable state when recovery cannot complete; never reset the source or erase live locks. |
| Local cloud placeholder, sharing-locked, missing or deleted file | Report the gap. Refresh when appropriate, or use an approved supported copy; do not force hydration/unlock or silently switch to a Graph source. Never answer from obsolete cached content. |
| Partial PDF / extraction gaps | Read the available pages for bounded claims and include skipped-page/gap details. A complete total/absence claim remains unsupported if relevant pages are unread. |
| Incomplete inventory, failed relevant files or bundle gaps | Resolve the gap or label a bounded subset. Bundle creation success is not proof of complete evidence or business coverage. |
| Stale source / stale or invalid cursor | Restart the affected file chain or enumeration without the cursor; never combine unmatched generations or sessions. |
| Unsupported, encrypted, damaged or over-limit content | State the actual limitation and a supported scoped alternative; identical retries do not remove deterministic limits. |
| Formula cache missing or stale | Preserve the formula/uncertainty; never substitute zero or claim recalculation. |
| No search results | State the searched scope; try meaningful aliases or enumerate before a stronger absence conclusion. |
| Cancelled/interrupted job | Inspect current job and coverage before refreshing. Cancellation is not successful coverage. |

Use the structured error's `retryable` and `next_action` fields. Do not reveal raw tracebacks. Ordinary answers can be concise: supported claim plus exact source/locator/version, with any material gap beside that claim.
